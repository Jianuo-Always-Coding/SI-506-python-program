## Useful Unix shell commands

Below is a select list of Unix shell commands that you can use from the command line to navigate
your local file system as well as create, delete, copy, and move directories and files. Additional
commmands are included that list the location of the current working directory or the path to an
executable, view the contents of a text file, and clear the terminal screen of content.

## 1.0 Location uncertain

If your terminal prompt provides no hint and you are unsure in which directory you currently
reside, use the built-in `pwd` command to print the current working directory.

### 1.1 macOS

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte
```

### 1.2 Windows

```bash
pwd

/c/Users/arwhyte
```

## 2.0 List files in the current working directory

If you require basic info about subdirectories and files that reside in the current directory,
use the `ls` command along with command options to print out the details.

:exclamation: the output below represents a subset of subdirectories and files found in a macOS home
directory; certain items have been excluded for display purposes only.

### 2.1 macOS

```bash
ls

Applications      Development      Music
Downloads         Documents        Pictures
Dropbox           Library          Postman
Desktop           Movies           Public
```

### 2.2 Windows

```bash
ls

```

### 2.3 ls command options (select list)

| Option | &nbsp; | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
| `-a`, |  `--all` | List all files including hidden `.` files. |
| `-d`, | `--directory` | List only directory information (not files). |
| `-l`, | `--format=long` | Long format listing (permissions, owner, size, modification time, etc.). |
| `-R`, | `--recursive` | Recursively list subdirectories as well as current directory |

:exclamation: the output below represents a subset of subdirectories and files found in a macOS home
directory; certain items have been excluded for display purposes only.

```bash

## 3.0 Change directory

If you need to change your current location, use the `cd` command to change your location to a
different working directory in your file system.

:exclamation: Note that directory names and file names are case sensitive.

### 3.1 Change to a child directory

You can change to child directory using a _relative_ path (i.e., relative to the current working
directory).

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte

cd Documents
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents
```

:bulb: the current working directory is denoted by a single dot (`.`).

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte

cd ./Documents
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents
```

:bulb: If you need to traverse n-levels deep you can do so by extending the relative path with
additional directory names separated by a slash (`/`).

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte

cd Documents/umsi

pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi
```

### 3.2 Change to a parent directory

Two dots (`..`) represent the parent directory or the directory one level up.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

cd ..
pwd

/Users/arwhyte
```

:bulb: You can concatenate the two dot parent directory notation using a slash as a separator
(e.g., `../../`) _n-times_ in order to traverse the directory tree _n-levels_ up.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

cd ../../
pwd

/Users
```

### 3.3 Change to an adjacent or sibling directory

You can switch to an adjacent or sibling directory by using the two dot notation (`..`) together
with the directory name separated by a slash (`/`). In the following example the `Documents`
directory contains two child directories: `umsi` and `umpy`.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi

cd ../umpy
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umpy
```

### 3.4 Change directory using an absolute path

You can also change directories using an _absolute_ path.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte

cd /Users/arwhyte/Documents
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents
```

### 3.5 Change to user's home directory

You can change to your home directory by using the tilde (`~`) character.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi

cd ~
pwd

/Users/arwhyte
```

### 3.6 Directory names with spaces

If you need to change to a directory that includes spaces in its name you _must_ either surround the
name with a pair of single or double quotation marks or escape the spaces with the backslash
(`\`) character.

:bulb: I recommend avoiding the use of spaces when naming directories or files in order to avoid
having to add quotation marks or escape characters to your paths. Instead consider using
underscores (`_`) if you want to separate characters in a directory or filename (e.g., `si_506`
not `si 506`).

While on the subject of filenames, the Python community's naming convention for filenames or
[modules](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id40) as they are called is as
follows:

> Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it
> improves readability.

```bash
pwd
/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi
âžœ  umsi ls

si 506

cd 'si 506'
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi/si 506

cd ..
cd "si 506"
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi/si 506

cd ..
cd si\ 506
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi/si 506
```

## 4.0 Create a directory

To create a new director use the `mkdir` command passing the name of the new directory as an
argument.

```bash
 pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

mkdir umich
ls

umich    umpy    umsi
```

:bulb: You can create multiple directories at the same time by passing multiple names each
separated by a space.

```bash
 pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

mkdir msu osu
ls

msu    osu    umich    umpy    umsi
```

## 5.0 Delete a directory

### 5.1 Delete an empty directory

To delete an _empty_ directory use the `rmdir` command passing the name of the directory you wish
to delete as an argument.

```bash
 pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

rmdir osu
ls

msu    umich    umpy    umsi
```

### 5.2 Delete a directory with content

To delete a directory that contains content (i.e., subdirectories and/or files) use the `rm` command
together with the `-r` recursive command option and either the `-f` force option or `i` interactive
command option.

### 5.2.1 rm command options (select list)

| Option | &nbsp; | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
| `-f`, |  `--force` | Remove write protected files without prompting. |
| `-i`, | `--interactive` | Prompt for `y` (yes) or `n` (no) before removing a file. Overrides `-f`. |
| `-r`, | `--recursive` | Remove all subdirectories and content recursively. |

```bash
rmdir msu

rmdir: msu: Directory not empty

cd msu
ls

spartans.txt

cd ..
rm -rf msu
ls

umich    umpy    umsi
```

## 6.0 Create a file

You can use the `touch` command to create an empty file by passing the new filename as an
argument.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umich

touch wolverines.txt
ls

wolverines.txt
```

## 7.0 View the contents of a text file

To view the contents of a text file use the `cat` command.

```bash
cat wolverines.txt

Go Blue!
```

## 8.0 Delete a file

You can use the `rm` command to delete a file.

```bash
rm delete_me.txt
```

## 9.0 Move a directory or file to another location

You can use the `mv` command to move a directory or file from one location to another. Specify the
_source_ directory or file (i.e., the directory or file you wish to move) and the _target_ location
as arguments.

:warning: if you move a file to a directory that contains a file with the same name you will
overwrite the existing file.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents

mv umpy umich/
mv umsi umich/
cd umich
ls

umpy    umsi    wolverines.txt
```

To move directories or files up one level employ the two dot notation with a trailing slash to
construct a relative path. You can also employ an absolute path (e.g., `/Users/arwhyte/Documents/`)
for the _target_ location.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/umsi/

ls
umpy    umsi    wolverines.txt

mv umpy ../
mv umsi ../

ls

wolverines.txt

cd ../
ls

umich    umpy    umsi
```

When you move a directory or file you can also change the name by specifying a new name in the
_target_ path.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/

cd umich
ls

wolverines.txt

mv wolverines.txt ../go_blue.txt
cd ../

ls

go_blue.txt    umich    umpy    umsi
```

:bulb: If you possess the requisite permissions and construct the correct _target_ path you can move
directories and files to any target location in your file system.

## 10.0 Copy a directory or file to another location

You can use the `cp` command to copy a directory or file to another location. Specify the
_source_ directory or file (i.e., the directory or file you wish to copy) and the _target_ location
as arguments.

:bulb: You can change the name of the directory or file you copy by specifying the new directory
name or filename as part of the _target_ path.

### 10.1 cp command options (select list)

| Option | &nbsp; | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- |
| `-f`, |  `--force` | Remove existing files in target directory. |
| `-i`, | `--interactive` | Prompt for `y` (yes) or `n` (no) before overwriting an existing file. |
| `-R`, | `--recursive` | Copy directories recursively. |

### 10.2 Copy a directory to another location

When you use the `cp` command to copy a directory to another location you _must_ also specify the command option `-R` in order to create a copy of the directory recursively. Otherwise, the copy
operation will fail.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/

mkdir program_01 program_02
cp -R program_01 umsi/msi
cp -R program_02 umsi/mhi
cd umsi
ls

mhi    msi
```

### 10.3 Copy a file to another location

Copying a file does not require use of the `-R` command option. Specify the _source_ directory or
file (i.e., the directory or file you wish to copy) and the _target_ location
as arguments.

```bash
pwd

/Users/arwhyte/Documents/

cp go_blue.txt umich/victors.txt

cd umich
ls

victors.txt
```

:bulb: you can copy multiple files to the same target path by passing the names as arguments before
specifying the target path.

```bash
cp go_blue.txt go_green.txt cheers/
```

Alternatively, you can employ a pattern matching wildcard (`*`).

```bash
cp *.txt cheers/
```

## 11.0 Clear the terminal screen

There are times when clearing the terminal screen of output makes sense. Use the `clear` command to
do so.

```bash
clear

```

## 12.0 which

The `which` command comes in handy when you need to identify the location of an executable that is
associated with a given command. For example, to return the executable path for Python 3.x pass the
command alias as the argument (Windows users pass `python`).

```bash
which python3

/usr/local/bin/python3
```

## 13.0 Start the Python interactive console

You can run the Python interactive console (a.k.a the Python shell) from the terminal. Once the
console is started the prompt will change. The new prompt comprises three greater than symbols
(`>>>`).

### 13.1 macOS

```bash
python3

Python 3.10.6 (main, Aug 11 2022, 13:36:31) [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### 13.2 Windows Git Bash

:exclamation: When using Git Bash you _must_ include the `-i` interactive command option or the
Python interactive console. If you fail to specify the `-i` option Git Bash will hang (terminate the
application and restart it).

```bash
python -i

Python 3.10.6 (tags/v3.10.6:9c7b4bd, Aug  1 2022, 21:53:49) [MSC v.1932 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You can also start the Python interactive console from Git Bash by first invoking `winpty`, a
Windows software package that provides an interface for running Windows console programs.

```bash
winpty python

Python 3.10.6 (tags/v3.10.6:9c7b4bd, Aug  1 2022, 21:53:49) [MSC v.1932 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### 13.3 Windows Command Prompt

You can also start the Python Interactive console using the the Command Prompt (`cmd`). The `-i`
command option is not required.

```bash
python

Python 3.10.6 (tags/v3.10.6:9c7b4bd, Aug  1 2022, 21:53:49) [MSC v.1932 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### 13.4 Quitting the console session

To exit the Python interactive console type `quit()` and then press enter.

```bash
>>> quit()
```
